6. Once you have the tables and data set up then you need to create queries to return the data needed as shown below:

   1. Show the title and director name for all films
	
	SELECT movies.title, directors.name
	FROM movies
	INNER JOIN directors ON movies.directorid = directors.directorid

   2. Show the title, director and star name for all films
	
	SELECT movies.title, directors.name as director_name, stars.name as star_name
	FROM movies
	INNER JOIN directors ON movies.directorid = directors.directorid
	INNER JOIN stars ON movies.starid = stars.starid

   3. Show the title of films where the director is from the USA

	SELECT movies.title, directors.country
	FROM movies
	INNER JOIN directors ON movies.directorid = directors.directorid
	WHERE directors.country = 'USA';

   4. Show only those films where the writer and the director are the same person

	SELECT movies.title, directors.name as director_name, writers.name as writer_name
	FROM movies
	INNER JOIN writers ON movies.writerid = writers.writerid
	INNER JOIN directors ON movies.directorid = directors.directorid
	WHERE writers.name = directors.name;

   5. Show directors and film titles for films with a score of 8 or higher

	SELECT movies.title, directors.name as director_name, movies.score
	FROM movies
	INNER JOIN directors ON movies.directorid = directors.directorid
	WHERE movies.score >= 8;

   6. Make at least 5 more queries to demonstrate your understanding of joins, and other relationships between tables.

    SELECT movies.title, directors.name as director_name, movies.genre
	FROM movies
	INNER JOIN directors ON movies.directorid = directors.directorid
	WHERE movies.genre IN ('Drama', 'Science Fiction');
   
    SELECT movies.title, directors.name as director_name, movies.score
	FROM movies
	INNER JOIN directors ON movies.directorid = directors.directorid
	WHERE movies.score >= 8
	AND movies.title LIKE '%a%';

	SELECT directors.name as director_name, AVG(movies.score)
	FROM movies
	INNER JOIN directors ON movies.directorid = directors.directorid
	GROUP BY directors.name;

	SELECT directors.country, AVG(movies.score)
	FROM movies
	INNER JOIN directors ON movies.directorid = directors.directorid
	GROUP BY directors.country;

	SELECT movies.genre, AVG(movies.score), Count(movies.genre)
	FROM movies
	GROUP BY movies.genre;
