1. Add a Cast table that links Films to Actors (ie the Cast table contains details of all of the Actors in addition to the Star who appear in the Film).

Renamed the stars table to actors (since then I don't have to make up new names)

Creating the table:

CREATE TABLE actor_in_cast(
	id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
	movie_id INT,
	actor_id,
	FOREIGN KEY (movie_id) REFERENCES movies(movieid)
	FOREIGN KEY (actor_id) REFERENCES actors(actor_id)
);

2. You can either add some more people as actors (these can be real actors or just made up names) or just reuse all of the existing people.

Inserted random movies to random actor_id's but, included always the star in the cast:

INSERT INTO actor_in_cast (movie_id, actor_id)
VALUES
(1, 1),(1,2),(1,3),
(2, 2),(2,10),(2,9),
(3, 3),(3,6),
(4, 4),
(5, 5),
(6,6),(6,1),(6,7),(6,10),
(7,7),(7,3),(7,8),(7,9),
(8,8),
(9,9),(9,2),
(10,10), (10,5), (10,2), (10, 3), (10, 4);

Let's test with a query:

SELECT ac.id, m.title, a_name.name
FROM actor_in_cast ac 
INNER JOIN movies m ON ac.movie_id = m.movieid
INNER JOIN actors a ON ac.actor_id = a.actor_id
INNER JOIN people a_name ON a.peopleid = a_name.peopleid
WHERE m.title = 'El Cid';

This gave the cast of the movie 'El Cid'
